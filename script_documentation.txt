The scripts directory should be scp'd onto the target node (which is assumed to have CentOS) in the
home directory.

- install_packages.sh should only be run once to install the libraries HPL needs and put them on the path.

Another bash shell should be run with the updated environment.

- build_hpl.sh will then build HPL but not run it.

- run_optimal_HPL.sh will run HPL with our best HPL.dat, and give the raw output in a file best_result.txt.

- TODO: get_graph_results.sh will run HPL on cores in the list [2, 4, 8, 16, 20] sequentially, and put the raw
output for each run in a graph_res subdirectory. This can then be scped onto your local machine, and the data
extracted and ploted with the python scripts extract.py and plot.py.
