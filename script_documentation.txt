The scripts directory should be scp'd onto the target node (which is assumed to have CentOS) in the

- install_packages.sh should only be run once to install the libraries HPL needs and put them on the path.

Another bash shell should be run with the updated environment.

- build_hpl.sh will then build HPL but not run it.

- run_optimal_HPL.sh will run HPL with our best HPL.dat, and give the raw output in a file best_result.txt.
